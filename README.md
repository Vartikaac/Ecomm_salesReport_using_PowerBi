# ECOMM Sales Report - Power BI Project

## Project Overview

This **ECOMM Sales Report** is designed to analyze sales, profit, shipping costs, and other key business metrics to help companies make data-driven decisions. The dashboard offers insights into top sales by country, state, market, and category, enabling companies to evaluate their performance in various regions and segments.

## Problem Statement

In a rapidly growing e-commerce environment, companies often struggle to track their performance across various markets and categories. Understanding sales patterns by country, state, product category, and shipping mode is essential for making informed decisions and improving profitability. Without a clear understanding of these patterns, companies may miss opportunities for optimization and growth.

This dashboard solves the problem by providing detailed visualizations of:
- Total sales, profit, and shipping costs
- Top 5 sales by country and state
- Sales trends across different markets and shipping modes
